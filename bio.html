  <h2>Growing up in Los Angeles</h2>
  <p>
    Early life: Raised in Los Angeles by a single immigrant mother, I faced significant challenges from a young age. Navigating difficult circumstances instilled in me an early understanding of the impact of choices, highlighting the significance of each decision, both positive and negative.
Navigating hardship: My father's absence due to alcoholism left a void that I unknowingly sought to fill on the streets. This search for guidance, unfortunately, led me down a destructive path, resulting in gang involvement and subsequent incarceration.
Transformation through adversity: Facing a life sentence, I reached a turning point. Within the confines of prison, I made a crucial choice that would forever alter my life's trajectory.

    My Adulthood
  </h2>
  <p>
    A life-altering event at the young age of 20 forced me to confront the harsh realities of
     incarceration and the daily struggles inherent within it. Battling deep depression and the hopelessness of
      isolation, I endured and overcame a decade of violence and negativity. A turning point arrived when I encountered a fellow 
      inmate who offered guidance and the prospect of education. Inspired by his influence and newfound self-reflection, I made a conscious 
      decision to break free from the cycle of violence and animalistic survival. Embracing personal growth and distancing myself from harmful 
      influences became my new normal. Joining a program that introduced me to the world of coding and software engineering ignited a spark of hope,
       illuminating a path away from the struggles and self-inflicted suffering I had known. This newfound passion became my map to escape, not just physically,
        but from the limitations I had previously believed were inescapable.
